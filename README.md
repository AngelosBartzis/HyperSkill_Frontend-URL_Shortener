This is the *URL Shortener* project I made myself.

Some website URLs can be very long â€” it would be good if we could shorten them. In this project, you will create a page to shorten website URLs. Practice manipulating the DOM using HTML & JS and build a web page.

Here's the link to the project: [https://hyperskill.org/projects/416](https://hyperskill.org/projects/328?track=5)
